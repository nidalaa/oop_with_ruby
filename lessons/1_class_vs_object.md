1. Class definition
    - move to directory `examples/1_1_class_definition`

      ```
      cd examples/1_1_class_definition
      ```
    - take a look at `animal.rb` file
    - try to use code in `irb` as described in `try_it_yourself.rb` file

2. Constructor and instance vars
    - move to directory `examples/1_2_constructor_and_vars`

      ```
      cd examples/1_2_constructor_and_vars
      ```
    - take a look at `animal.rb` file
    - try to use code in `irb` as described in `try_it_yourself.rb` file

3. Constructor with parameters
    - move to directory `examples/1_3_class_with_params`

      ```
      cd examples/1_3_class_with_params
      ```
    - take a look at `animal.rb` file
    - try to use code in `irb` as described in `try_it_yourself.rb` file

4. Constructor with optional parameters
    - move to directory `examples/1_4_class_with_optional_params`

      ```
      cd examples/1_4_class_with_optional_params
      ```
    - take a look at `animal.rb` file

5. Method definition
    - move to directory `examples/1_5_method_definition`

      ```
      cd examples/1_5_method_definition

# Learn by experience

Create class Person with:
- instance vars: @id, @name, @age
- constructor with name and age as parameter (name should be optional [default "Unknown"])
- extra method is_of_age? (returns true/false)
