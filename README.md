This is a small project that will help you familiarize yourself with Object Oriented Programming with Ruby.

### Each lesson consists on the following sections:
- **Get ready**: some recommended readings and resources to get you ready for the real action.
- **Examples**: code that you can follow and will show you how to build a small app step by step.
- **Requirements**: Tasks that you have to implement (based on the examples) to build *your own* small app step by step.

### General rules:
- You can read the links in the "Get ready" section before or after playing with the examples.
- In each lesson, you should go to the correct directory in the `examples` folder and...
    - take a look at the changes in the files
    - run the code on the `try_it_yourself` file line by line and observe the result (sometimes the result is an error that will be solved in next lesson)
- The files created in each task should be saved in the `your_project` directory
